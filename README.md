# SentimentAnalysis

These files track my fun learning of basic sentiment analysis techniques. 

## Files
### text_classification_IMDB_reviews_BOW
This file uses the IMDB data set that comes with a vector embedding of words similar to the Bag of Words approach where
a word's value comes from it index in a dictionary. I was able to get 84% accuracy here on a test set of 25k reviews using a 
simple Neural Network

### Future Work: using Word2Vec to embed words, using a CNN to build the model, trying out Google's [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert) if possible
